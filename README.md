# Typorithms

**Typorithms** is a collection of Data Structures and Algorithms implemented in **TypeScript**, designed to enhance your understanding and mastery of computational problem-solving. It’s ideal for beginners, experienced developers, and anyone preparing for coding interviews.

## Roadmap

This project is a work-in-progress and expected to be complete by 4 Janurary, 2025.
Here is a quick roadmap to give you an idea:

1. Add more data-strcutures and algorithms (e.g., Lists, Graph Algorithms, Greedy Algorithms).
2. Implement advanced data structures (e.g., Trees, Heaps, Tries).
3. Add detailed comments and explanations in each file.

The following will be an addition to this repository:

1. Collect feedback for more changes & videos. Through Twitter / X: https://x.com/owlrana
2. Create video tutorials for selected topics. On Youtube: https://www.youtube.com/@owlranaYT
3. Add a web interface to visualize algorithms. TBD.

## Prerequisites

To get started with Typorithms, make sure you have the following installed:

1. **Node.js**: [Download Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v16 or higher is recommended).
2. **TypeScript**: can install TypeScript globally by:
    ```
    npm install -g typescript
    ```
3. **ts-node**: optional but preferred, for running TypeScript files directly without compiling:
    ```
    npm install -g ts-node
    ```

## Getting started

1. Clone the repository, navigate to the project directory and install dependencies.
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/owlrana/Typorithms.git
    cd typorithms
    npm install
    ```
2. To run the file of your choice, use ts-node with file path. For eg.
    ```
    ts-node src/data-structures/array/03-linear-search-in-array.ts
    ```

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! To contribute:

1. Fork the repository.
2. Create a new branch.
    ```
    git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
    ```
3. Commit your changes.
    ```
    git commit -m "careful(think): your commit message is very important"
    ```
4. Push to the branch.
    ```
    git push origin feature/your-feature-name
    ```
5. Open a pull request.
